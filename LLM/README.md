# AI and Machine Learning Concepts

## Large Language Model (LLM)

A probabilistic model of natural language that generates words based on the data it was trained on. It uses deep learning techniques and massively large datasets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. Notably, it does not truly understand the language.

### Applications

- Bert
- Gpt 3 and Gpt 4
- Llama 2 (Meta)

### Training

The model is trained using large parameters connected by using layers and a large dataset. The training process involves using 10k GPUs.

### Fine-tuning

The process of optimizing a specific parameter for a specific task.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

A type of model used for generating augmented data.

## Transformer

A type of model used in machine learning.

### Components

- Encoder
- Decoder

## Evaluation Methods

- Automated benchmarking
- Using humans as judges
- Using models as judges

## GenAI - Generative AI

A type of AI that can generate new, previously unseen data.
