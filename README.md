# Work Items Summary

1. Enhance UI Recipes: Improve current front-ends by picking the best candidate from Open Source to create better UI recipes for GenAI/LLM routines.

2. Nokia LLM Benchmark: Develop a dataset of questions/tasks with known good answers and a framework to measure the performance of different LLMs, prompts, and recipes in mobile network use cases.

3. Support GenAI Projects: Assist GenAI projects by solving sub-problems of choice, writing small programs/recipes to enable bigger progress, and creating benchmark questions for LLMs.

Tech Stack: Python for backend, React for frontend, or variations of React-style programming.

Athena Advisory
This sub-team is dedicated to coaching, incubating, and rapidly prototyping a variety of GenAI use cases within CNS (internal initiatives) and with strategic lead customers (external projects). Occasionally, the team also experiments with new approaches to address the unique requirements of different use cases.

The primary goal of Athena Advisory is to accelerate the development pipeline of promising use cases, with an emphasis on prioritization, consolidation of similar projects, and broad dissemination of GenAI skills across the organization.
